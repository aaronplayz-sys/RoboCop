**_I highly suggest reading through the guides as some cogs may be a bit complicated!_**
I take no responsibility for misuse of my cogs.

|--|--|--|--|
| [slashsync](https://github.com/aaronplayz-sys/RoboCop/tree/main/slashsync)| swapped imports and `bot.command()` to be compatible with red and made into a cog. | [Umbra's Rantings](https://about.abstractumbra.dev/discord.py/2023/01/29/sync-command-example.html) | was not a cog to begin with. |
