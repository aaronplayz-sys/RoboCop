Click on the cog names to get to my wiki page and learn about them.

**_I highly suggest reading through the guides as some cogs may be a bit complicated!_**
I take no responsibility for misuse of my cogs.

## Modified cogs

| cog name | What was modified | Original repo or source | Why?  |
|--|--|--|--|
| Tube (Removed) | * | Redacted | Removed, as another maintainer has continued it's development. Plus cog no longer seems to be fit for video checks. |
| [slashsync](https://github.com/aaronplayz-sys/RoboCop/tree/main/slashsync)| swapped imports and `bot.command()` to be compatible with red and made into a cog. | [Umbra's Rantings](https://about.abstractumbra.dev/discord.py/2023/01/29/sync-command-example.html) | was not a cog to begin with. |


## Changelog

1/6/2025

The Tube cog has been removed. Personally I only had it since the original creator didn't maintain it, and it broke in one of Red's updates and patched it myself. Someone else now maintains the cog, however I am using the YouTube cog from [mr42-cogs](https://github.com/Mister-42/mr42-cogs) repo.  I personally recommend this cog as there is more customizable options and can migrate current subscriptions from the Tube cog.
